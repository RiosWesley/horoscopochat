# Horóscopo das Mensagens - Project Progress

## Goal

Create a functional web application that analyzes uploaded WhatsApp chat `.txt` files locally in the browser to generate fun, horoscope-style insights based on message content and patterns.

## Current Plan & Status

1.  **File Handling (`InstructionsPage.tsx`):**
    *   [X] Implement reading of the uploaded `.txt` file using `FileReader`.
    *   [X] Implement reading of WhatsApp chat `.zip` export using `jszip` to extract `.txt`.
    *   [X] Store the raw text content (from `.txt` or extracted from `.zip`) in shared state (React Context).
    *   [X] Navigate to `/analyzing` upon successful file read/extraction.
2.  **Parsing (`src/lib/parseChat.ts`):**
    *   [X] Create a function to parse raw text into structured message objects (`{timestamp, sender, message}`).
    *   [X] Handle basic WhatsApp message formats (user messages, system messages, multi-line).
    *   [X] Refine date/time parsing to handle more formats (DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, AM/PM, different separators).
    *   [X] Refine system message detection using keywords. *Further variations might need refinement.*
    *   [X] Fix parsing to correctly identify "mensagem editada" as a system message.
3.  **Analysis (`src/lib/analyzeChat.ts`):**
    *   [X] Create basic analysis function structure.
    *   [X] Implement counts for total messages and messages per sender.
    *   [X] Implement emoji counting and find most frequent emoji.
    *   [X] Implement peak hour calculation (statistic kept, view removed).
    *   [X] Implement counts for basic keywords (laughter, questions, positive, negative).
    *   [X] Implement average message length calculation.
    *   [X] Implement "Palavra Favorita" analysis (most frequent significant word).
    *   [X] Fix "Palavra Favorita" bug related to media placeholders.
    *   [X] Implement punctuation emphasis (!!!, ???) and CAPS word analysis.
    *   [X] Implement simple heuristic rules for generating insights (Signo, Pequenas Verdades) in `ResultsPage.tsx`.
    *   [X] Refine heuristics to incorporate punctuation/CAPS data.
    *   [X] Further refine heuristics for more varied/combined insights (Signo combination, talkative person fact).
    *   [X] Implement common expression (bigram) analysis.
    *   [X] Implement response time analysis per sender.
4.  **State Management (React Context):**
    *   [X] Set up `ChatAnalysisContext` to hold raw text, parsed messages, analysis results, and loading state.
    *   [X] Use specific types (`ParsedMessage`, `AnalysisResults`).
    *   [X] Update `AnalysisResults` interface with new fields (keywords, avg length, favoriteWord, punctuation, CAPS, expressions).
    *   [X] Add chart view selection state for different time period displays.
    *   [X] Add focused sender state for detailed sender analysis view.
5.  **Page Updates:**
    *   [X] Update `AnalyzingPage` to trigger parsing and analysis, update Context, and navigate.
    *   [X] Update `ResultsPage` to display basic analysis results (total messages, sender counts) from Context, including loading/error states.
    *   [X] Update `ResultsPage` to display most frequent emoji and peak hour statistic.
    *   [X] Update `ResultsPage` to display generated Signo and Pequenas Verdades based on heuristics.
    *   [X] Update `ResultsPage` to display average message length and keyword insights.
    *   [X] Update `ResultsPage` to display "Mix de Vibrações" based on positive/negative keywords.
    *   [X] Update `ResultsPage` to display "Palavra Favorita".
    *   [X] Update heuristics in `ResultsPage.tsx` to use keyword, avg length, punctuation, and CAPS data.
    *   [X] Add Signo description generation and display.
    *   [X] Add per-sender analysis calculation in `analyzeChat.ts`.
    *   [X] Add per-sender analysis display section in `ResultsPage.tsx`.
    *   [ ] ~~Connect ActivityHeatmap to real data.~~ (Component/View removed)
    *   [X] Connect SentimentChart to real data (positive/negative keywords).
    *   [X] Connect Chat Info Strip to real message count, active days, and date range.
    *   [X] Remove mock Personality Traits section.
    *   [X] Connect Expressions section to real data.
    *   [X] Add response time display to per-sender analysis in `ResultsPage.tsx`.
    *   [X] Add detailed sender focus view for deep-diving into individual participants.
    *   [X] Enhance context with view controls for different chart periods and focused sender state.
    *   [X] Fix FloatingEmoji component to support non-animated mode.
    *   [X] Implement social sharing image generation and triggering in `handleShare`.
    *   [X] Add daily and weekly message count calculation to `analyzeChat.ts`.
    *   [X] Integrate `TimelineChart` for daily/weekly views in `ResultsPage.tsx` (Removed Hourly chart view).
    *   [X] Add premium analysis calculation (Passive-Aggressive, Flirtation) to `analyzeChat.ts` (including per-sender counts and overall/per-sender percentages).
    *   [X] Add conditional UI in `ResultsPage.tsx` to display premium analysis (overall and per-sender percentages) based on mock state.
    *   [X] Improve text color contrast for "Flerte" percentage in per-sender analysis (`ResultsPage.tsx`).
    *   [X] Implement AI-powered creative text generation (prediction/poem) via Cloud Function (`functions/src/index.ts`, `ResultsPage.tsx`).
    *   [X] Implement AI-powered communication style analysis via Cloud Function (`functions/src/index.ts`, `ResultsPage.tsx`).
    *   [X] Add frontend logic for token limiting and message anonymization for AI style analysis (`ResultsPage.tsx`).
    *   [X] Add UI sections in `ResultsPage.tsx` to display AI-generated premium content.
6.  **UI Components & Visualization:**
    *   [X] Create `ContactBubble` component to display sender names and message counts.
    *   [X] Create `SentimentChart` component using Recharts for displaying sentiment analysis.
    *   [ ] ~~Create `ActivityHeatmap` component for visualizing message frequency by hour.~~ (Component/View removed)
    *   [X] Create `EmojiCloud` component for displaying emoji usage statistics.
    *   [X] Create `FloatingEmoji` component with optional animation effects.
    *   [X] Fix `EmojiCloud` component size prop type issue.

    *   [X] Add personality traits visualization section.
    *   [X] Improve visual styling of result cards and sections.
    *   [X] Add premium feature teaser and share functionality.
    *   [X] Create SenderFocus component for detailed analysis of individual chat participants.
    *   [X] Add tabbed interface for sender details, showing profile, statistics, and emoji usage.
    *   [X] Create `ShareableImage` component for rendering results to an image.
    *   [X] Create `TimelineChart` component for daily/weekly activity visualization.

## Next Steps

*   Add animations for transitions between different views and states.
*   Further refine chat parsing for any remaining edge cases if needed.
*   Deploy Firebase Cloud Function (`callGemini`).
*   Implement *actual* premium features and subscription handling (currently mocked).
*   Securely manage API keys using environment variables/secrets management for production.
*   Add explicit user consent flow for sending data to AI APIs.
*   Add animations for transitions between different views and states.
*   Add tutorial/onboarding overlays to guide users through the application.
